He stated that the purpose of this book was a reply to the widespread notion that society no longer needs critique from the left. He hopes to restore the left as a \"very necessary part of the political argument.\" Articles included in the book were published in various periodicals.",

      "text": "For a lot of people, their first love is what they'll always remember. For me it's always been the first hate, and I think that hatred, though it provides often rather junky energy, is a terrific way of getting you out of bed in the morning and keeping you going. If you don't let it get out of hand, it can be canalized into writing. In this country where people love to be nonjudgmental when they can be, which translates as, on the whole, lenient, there are an awful lot of bubble reputations floating around that one wouldn't be doing one's job if one didn't itch to prick."
